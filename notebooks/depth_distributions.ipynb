    "## Calculating Snow Depth and Ice Thickness Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Snow depth and ice thickness can vary over length scales as short as 100 m.  However, grids of modelled snow depths and satellite-derived ice thicknesses are generally available with cell spacings of 25 km.  For snow depths this grid spacing is determined by the resolution of output grids from atmospheric reanalyses.  For satellite-derived ice thickness products, grid spacing is limited by either the extent of satellite footprints and/or the number of data points to generate grids from sparse points and transects.  It is advantageous to account for subgrid-scale variability of snow depths and ice thickness.  This notebook demonstrates how sub-grid-scale variability is accounted for in the radiative transfer model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mallet et al (2021) developed probability distributions for snow depth anomalies for snow on sea ice using snow data collected along transects at Russian drifting stations [refe].  Snow depths for each transect measured on a given date were standardized using the mean and standard deviation of snow depths for each transect.  Standard anomaly snow depths $d'$ for each transect are given by:\n",
