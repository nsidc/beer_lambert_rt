    "The notebook demonstrates estimating photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) under sea ice following @stroeve_multi-sensor_2021.  The approach of @stroeve_multi-sensor_2021 is based on that of @maykut1971 and @grenfell_optical_1977.  The approach uses apparent optical properties (albedo $\\alpha$ and attenuation coefficient $\\kappa$) in a two level Bouger-Lambert-Beer exponential decay model.  The first level represents the surface scattering layer - not included for dry snow.  The second level is snow-ice column.\n",

Incoming solar radiation is absorbed (or scattered) by this SSL.  @maykut1971 account for this reduction in radiation transmitted through the SSL with a surface transmission function $i_{0}$.  Radiation is then attenuated by the snow (if present) and ice layers below the SSL.  Snow and ice have different attenuation coefficients (_Need Ref_).  The transmission coefficient $T_{ocean}$ for a snow covered ice is the product of two exponential terms, one for snow and one for ice.\n",
