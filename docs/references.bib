	abstract = {Measurements of light transmission and reflection were carried out on first-year sea ice near Point Barrow, Alaska, and on multi-year ice near Fletcher’s Ice Island in the Beaufort Sea (lat. 84° N., long. 77°W.). Spectral albedos (400-1 000 nm) and extinction coefficients (400-800 nm) were determined for melt ponds, snow, and various types of bare ice. Albedos were largest in the 400-600 nm range, decreasing toward longer wavelengths at a rate which appeared to be related to the liquid-water content of the near-surface layers. Extinction coefficients remained nearly constant between 400 and 550 nm, but increased rapidly above 600 nm. At 500 nm, albedos ranged from 0.25 over mature melt ponds to 0.93 over dense dry snow, while the corresponding extinction coefficients ranged from 0.6 to 16 m-1. Intensity profiles taken in the upper 50 cm of the ice indicated that the extinction coefficient at a particular wavelength was nearly constant with depth below 15 cm, although the bulk extinction coefficient decreased with depth because of the strong attenuation in the red. Near the surface it was found that multi-year ice absorbed slightly more energy than did first-year blue ice, but at depths below 10 cm the flux divergence in the first-year ice was three to four times larger than that in the multi-year ice. A simple procedure is described for estimating light transmission and absorption within the ice under clear or cloudy skies from total flux measurements at the surface. Methods by which satellite data could be used to estimate regional albedos, melt-pond fraction, and lead area are also presented.},

	abstract = {Arctic sea ice is shifting from a year-round sea ice cover to a seasonal sea ice cover. This substantial transformation, via a reduction in Arctic sea ice extent and a thinning of its thickness, influences the amount of light entering the upper ocean. This in turn impacts under-ice algal growth and associated ecosystem dynamics. Field campaigns have provided valuable insights as to how snow and ice properties impact light penetration at fixed locations in the Arctic, but to understand the spatial variability in the underice light field there is a need to scale up to the pan-Arctic level. Combining information from satellites with state-of-the-art parameterizations is one means to achieve this. This study combines satellite and modelled data products to map under-ice light on a monthly time-scale from 2011 through 2018. Key limitations pertain to the availability of satellite-derived sea ice thickness, which for radar altimetry, is only available during the sea ice growth season. We clearly show that year-to-year variability in snow depth, along with the fraction of thin ice, plays a key role in how much light enters the Arctic Ocean. This is particularly significant in April which in some regions, coincides with the beginning of the under-ice algal bloom, whereas we find that ice thickness is the main driver of under-ice light availability at the end of the melt season in October. The extension to the melt season due to a warmer Arctic means that snow accumulation has reduced, which is leading to positive trends in light transmission through snow, which combined with a thinner ice cover, should lead to increased under-ice PAR also in the summer months.},
